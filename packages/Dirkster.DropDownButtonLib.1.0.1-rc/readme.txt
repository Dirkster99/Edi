DropDownButtonLib

The DropDownButtonLib project supplies MVVM/WPF drop down controls that are based on a button. This project is based on the drop down control contained in the Extended WPF Toolkit™ Community Edition:https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/ from Xceed.

This project includes some bugfixes to the original implementation and extends the original controls:

    DropDownButton, SplitButton


with:

    DropDownItemsButton, SplitItemsButton


controls. The original implementation (DropDownButton, SplitButton) can be used to drop down and interact with single drop down items, while the extended controls (DropDownItemsButton, SplittItemsButton) are based on an ItemsControl and can thus be with multiple drop down items (in a similar fashion as a ComboBox or ListBox).
